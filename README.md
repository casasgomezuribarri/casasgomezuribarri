👋 Hi, I’m @casasgomezuribarri (Ivan)

- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and visualisation, with a strong focus on the study of how systems work in nature.
- 🌱 I’m an MSci Zoology student in the UK, and I'm additionally learning how to do machine learning in Julia.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the study of ecological systems. I am especially attracted to disease and vector ecology and ecosystem functions and services.
- 📫 If looking for a motivated student with an ability and intention to continued self-teaching and personal development, and an appreciation of the power of computational tools in the study of ecological systems, drop me an email to ivicasas@gmail.com and tell me more!
